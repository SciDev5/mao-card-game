/* Created by Aapuji
 * 
 * This program has a "Priority" struct which represents
 * the order of which rules would be applied. As of now,
 * only the default order is used in the game, but for a
 * future expansion, the order could be randomized each game.
 * 
 * ActionOption is an enum which corresponds to Actions,
 * but don't do anything. The main difference is in the
 * "Say" variant, which for `Action::Say`, has an argument
 * (the message), while in `ActionOption::Say` doesn't.
